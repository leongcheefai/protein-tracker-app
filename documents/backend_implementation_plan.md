## API Design Principles

### RESTful Architecture
- Consistent URL structure
- Proper HTTP methods and status codes
- Resource-based endpoints
- Stateless design

### Request/Response Format
```javascript
// Standard Success Response
{
  success: true,
  data: {...},
  message: "Operation completed successfully"
}

// Standard Error Response
{
  success: false,
  error: {
    code: "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    message: "Invalid input data",
    details: {...}
  }
}
```

### Authentication Flow
1. Frontend authenticates with Supabase Auth
2. Backend verifies Supabase JWT token
3. User data retrieved from user_profiles table with RLS
4. Subsequent requests include verified user context

## Database Schema Design

### Key Tables
- `user_profiles` - User profiles and preferences (extends auth.users)
- `foods` - Food database with nutrition info
- `meals` - User meal entries
- `meal_foods` - Junction table linking meals to foods
- `food_detections` - AI food detection results
- `analytics` - Computed nutrition analytics (future)

### Indexing Strategy
- User-based queries: Automatic UUID indexes
- Date-based queries: `timestamp` indexes with DESC ordering
- Food searches: GIN indexes on food names for full-text search
- JSONB indexes for nutrition data queries
- Composite indexes for user + date queries

## Security & Performance

### Security Measures
- Supabase authentication with JWT verification
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data isolation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- File upload security with type validation
- Environment variable protection
- PostgreSQL constraint validations

### Performance Optimizations
- Supabase connection pooling (built-in)
- Query optimization with proper indexing
- JSONB for efficient nutrition data storage
- Image compression and Supabase Storage CDN
- Response caching where appropriate
- Pagination for large datasets
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- DatabaseService methods
- Service layer logic
- Utility functions
- Authentication middleware
- TypeScript type safety

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint testing with Supabase
- Database operations with RLS policies
- External service integration (OpenAI, Storage)
- File upload workflows
- Authentication flows

### Load Testing
- API performance under load
- PostgreSQL query optimization
- Image processing bottlenecks
- Supabase connection limits

## Deployment & DevOps

### Environment Setup
- Development: Local development with Supabase project
- Staging: Staging Supabase project with separate database
- Production: Production Supabase project with live data

### CI/CD Pipeline
1. Code commit triggers build
2. Automated testing suite
3. Security scanning
4. Staging deployment
5. Manual production deployment

### Monitoring & Logging
