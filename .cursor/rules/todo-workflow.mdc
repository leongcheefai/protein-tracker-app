# To-Do List Workflow

## Always Create To-Do Lists
When a new task is added, immediately create a comprehensive to-do list breaking down the requirements into actionable steps.

## Step-by-Step Execution
- Work through each task systematically
- Check off completed tasks as you go
- Don't move to the next task until the current one is fully completed
- Update the to-do list if new requirements or dependencies are discovered

## To-Do List Format
Use this structure for organizing tasks:
```markdown
## Task: [Task Name]

### To-Do:
- [ ] Step 1: [Description]
- [ ] Step 2: [Description]
- [ ] Step 3: [Description]
- [ ] Step 4: [Description]

### Completed:
- [x] Step 1: [Description] ✅
- [x] Step 2: [Description] ✅

### Notes:
- Additional information or decisions made
```

## Progress Tracking
- Mark tasks with ✅ when completed
- Add notes about decisions or changes made
- Keep the list updated throughout the development process
- Reference the list when explaining progress to users
